![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23224088/29910100-697f6076-8ddd-11e7-9279-dde9401b92cd.png)

## Issue Summary
At 12:50 PM PDT on August 8, 2017, Twitter user Elaine Yeung ([@egsy](https://twitter.com/egsy)) launched a tweet campaign targeting [Slack](https://slack.com/). The goal of the campaign was to apply social pressure on Slack so that they would make an exception to their [Slack for Education](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/206646877-Slack-for-Education) screening process and recognize [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.com/) as an educational organization. The parent tweet was retweeted 6 times and received 14 likes. Within three hours, Slack responded and held firm to their existing policy. The goal of receiving an education discount was not achieved, rendering the tweet campaign a failure.


## Timeline

#### Definitions

According to [Twitter's documentation](https://business.twitter.com/en/help/campaign-measurement-and-analytics/tweet-activity-dashboard.html), every tweet generates a number of analytic points. The three points of analysis referenced in the table below are:

> - Impressions: Times people were served a Tweet in timeline or search results
> - Engagements: Total number of times someone interacted with a Tweet. Clicks anywhere on the Tweet, including Retweets, replies, follows, likes, links, cards, hashtags, embedded media, username, profile photo, or Tweet expansion
> - Engagement rate: The number of engagements divided by the number of impressions

### Issue detection and actions taken

- **2015-2016** - Elaine oversaw her the adoption of Slack at her previous organization and is a self-proclaimed super-fan of the service.
- **November 2016 - ongoing** - Elaine enrolled at Holberton School. After several months of observing Slack usage at school, she identified ways in which students at the school could optimize their usage of the service
  - **March 1, 2017** - for her first stand-up talk, Elaine chose to [highlight ways in which classmates could better use Slack](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1FdCK0YN-zLkhrYFFGnHBcKTXhygZM6oSsl-upRb3KFE/edit?usp=sharing). During stand-up she learned that Slack did not recognize Holberton School as an educational institution.

### Level of incident escalation

- August 8, 2017 - Elaine messaged #all_hippokampoiers channel on slack asking them to retweet and/or like her original tweet. 
  - August 25, 2017 - The #all_hippokampoiers channel has 130 users.
  - Six users retweeted the link while 14 users liked it. 

### Incident resolution

- Slack's response to Elaine resolved the incident.

##  Root cause

Identifying the root cause of this incident proved challenging. Ultimately, two root causes were identified: first, the reason that the Twitter campaign was launched and second, for the reason that the Twitter campaign failed.
1. Holberton School is currently using a free account and does not qualify for the educational discount.
   - Free accounts on Slack have restrictive limitations:
	 - Restriction 1: Messages older than 10,000 messages are archived.
	   - With each new batch of students enrolled, the number of users on the Holberton School Slack team is ever increasing.
	   - With more members sending more messages, messages are quickly lost. One of Slack's hallmark functions is its ability to search message archives.
	   - At the school's current rate of slack usage, 10,000 messages are sent within a three week period, rendering all messages older than that unsearchable.
	 - Restriction 2: Teams are limited to only three apps or integrations.
	   - Holberton School's team cannot fully benefit from the wide range of apps and integrations available on Slack.

2. Elaine missed key opportunites to strategically position supporters of Holberton School prior to the Twitter campaign
   - The intent of this Twitter campaign was to apply social pressure on Slack; ideally, the outcome would be for Slack to make an exception and provide Holberton School with an Slack for Education discount. 
   - Elaine, the initiator and organizer of this campaign, failed to:
	 - ... predict the amount of time that it would take for Slack to resond
	   - Since Slack responded in less than three hours after the initial tweet, the campaign quickly lost momentum
	 - ... communicate her intent to any Holberton School supporters prior to campaign launch
	   - More time was lost in the minutes 
	 - ... gather enough retweets and likes in a limited span of time
	   - Elaine was largely inspired by [Carter Wilkerson's](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/teen-free-nuggets-wendys-breaks-twitter-record-article-1.3150258) appeal to Wendy's for a year's worth of chicken nuggets. Whereas Carter's original tweet was almost immediately retweeted and supported by his high school classmates, Elaine's tweet was retweeted by less than 5% of the students in #all_hippokampoiers.
	   
## Resolution and recovery

Both root causes are unresolved. As a reflective measure, Elaine chose to focus her post mortem assignment on this failed Twitter campaign.

## Corrective and Preventative measures

The following actions may be taken to prevent this failure from repeating: 

1. Slack free account limitations
   - Continue educating Holberton School Slack team users how to best use the platform in spite of its limitations
	 - Consider integrating content from Elaine's presentation into new student welcome documentation so they arrive to school knowing:
	   - **how** to save messages by starring them
	   - **why** reaction emojis should be preferred over one word messages such as 'ok' 'thx'
	   - **basic slash command** functionality such as `/remind` and `/collapse`
   - Work with current students (such as Steven) to create a utility that backs up Slack data to a local source

2. Reaching viral status with a Twitter campaign
   - The relationship between audience appeal and prior planning to a campaign is inverse:
	 - The **less** a campaign appeals to the general public, the **more** planning needs to happen prior to campaign launch.
   - Study other successful viral Twitter campaigns to identify and extract trends that can be universally applied to other campaigns.
